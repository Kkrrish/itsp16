This piece of code is an attempt to decide the best shot for our carrom bot. Basically, through Image Processing, we will first 
obtain the co-ordinates of all the black, white, and red coins, and also their radius. Once that happens, we need to pick a 
coin that will be the easiet shot for our bot. So we build up from various cases like single shot, double shot, cut shot etc. 
and the final objective is to return the angle and power with which to strike.
